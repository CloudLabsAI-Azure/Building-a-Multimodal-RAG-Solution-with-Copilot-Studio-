# Challenge: Develop a Health Symptom and Disease Identification Copilot agent using Azure OpenAI and Copilot Studio

### Estimated Time: 4 Hours
  
## Problem Statement

Develop an intelligent health symptom identification bot that helps individuals to assess potential diseases based on the symptoms they experience. The system will allow users to input their symptoms, which will then be matched against a database of diseases. The system will return a list of possible diseases associated with the provided symptoms, including their severity level, a brief yet informative description of each disease, and tailored precautionary steps or recommendations to manage or prevent further complications.

## Goals

- Match the input symptoms to a list of diseases.

- Display a brief description of each disease.

## Datasets 

- Download and extract the datasets for this challenge using the [symptoms_datasets](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Building-a-Multimodal-RAG-Solution-with-Copilot-Studio-/archive/refs/heads/health-Dataset.zip) link. Please make sure you extract these files inside `C:\LabFiles`.
