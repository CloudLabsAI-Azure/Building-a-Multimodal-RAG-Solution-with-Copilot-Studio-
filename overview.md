# Develop a Health Symptom and Disease Identification Copilot agent using Azure OpenAI and Copilot Studio

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of AI by building a Disease Identification System using Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search. Dive into hands-on learning to create an intelligent system using tools like Copilot Studio.

## Introduction

Your quest is to create an AI-powered Disease Identification System that helps users identify potential diseases based on their symptoms. Using tools like Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Copilot Studio, you’ll integrate AI capabilities to enhance accessibility and efficiency in healthcare solutions.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Set up and manage Azure OpenAI services, including deploying GPT-4 models for intelligent responses.

- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to connect large language models with datasets for context-driven, accurate responses.

- Integrate Azure AI Search with vectorized indexes for efficient symptom-based disease identification.

- Utilize Copilot Studio to build and deploy an interactive conversational AI bot.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based
This hackathon adopts a challenge-based format, offering you a unique opportunity to learn while dealing with a practical problem. The challenge includes one or more objectives designed to test and enhance your skills in specific aspects.

- Analyzing the problem statement.
- Strategizing your approach to find the most effective solution.
- Leveraging the provided lab environment and Azure AI services.
  
## Challenge Overview

Begin your journey by setting up Azure OpenAI Service and deploying a GPT-4 model along with a text-embedding model. Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to connect the models with the datasets you’ve been provided. This will enable the system to pull relevant information from the datasets based on user input, enhancing the disease identification process. The RAG approach will allow the system to generate accurate, context-specific responses by integrating both the power of large language models and real-time data retrieval.
